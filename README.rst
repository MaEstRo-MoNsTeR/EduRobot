A multipurpose Telegram Bot made with Pyrogram and asynchronous programming.


Requirements
------------
- Python 3.6+
- An Unix-like operating system (Running on Windows isn't 100% supported. In case you find any issues inside Windows, please file an issue)


Setup
-----
- Install the required modules from the requirements.txt with ``pip3 install -Ur requirements.txt``.
- Go to https://my.telegram.org/apps and create a new app.
- Create a new ``config.py`` file from the ``config.py.example`` file (``cp config.py.example config.py``).

Running
-------
- To run the bot you just need to run ``python3 bot.py``.
- Running it on `screen <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Screen>`__ or `tmux <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tmux>`__ is highly recommended if you want to keep the bot running on a server.
